OSM Hall Monitor Webserver
==========================

** CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT; THINGS COULD CHANGE **

This repository is a web server interface for the [OSM Hall Monitor](https://github.com/ethan-nelson/osm_hall_monitor). It provides both a user-facing graphical web interface and a RESTful API. It is a replacement to the [old OSM Hall Monitor site](https://github.com/ethan-nelson/osmhm_site) that was really the first web application I built from scratch and thus very rough around the edges.

Stay tuned for updates.
